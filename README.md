Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller Design and Analysis:

The project aims to analyze the performance of different controller configurations, including PID, PI, PD, P, and no overshoot control. The following summary provides an overview of the project's findings and results:

1. Controller Configurations:
   - PID Controller: The PID controller combines proportional, integral, and derivative control actions.
   - PI Controller: The PI controller incorporates proportional and integral control actions. It focuses on reducing steady-state error while maintaining      stability.
   - PD Controller: The PD controller utilizes proportional and derivative control actions. 
   - P Controller: The P controller only employs proportional control action.
   - No Overshoot Control: This configuration aims to design a controller that eliminates or minimizes overshoot, ensuring a smooth response without exceeding the desired setpoint.

2. System Performance Measures:
   - Various dynamic performance measures were considered, including rise time, settling time, overshoot, and steady-state error. These measures help evaluate the effectiveness of different controller configurations in meeting the desired system response characteristics. 

3. Analysis and Comparison:
   - The project analyzed the response of the system under each controller configuration through simulation and analysis using MATLAB.
   - Performance measures were calculated and compared across the different configurations to assess their effectiveness in achieving the desired response.
   - The PID controller was evaluated in terms of its ability to balance steady-state error, response speed, and stability.
   - The PI and PD controllers were assessed for their impact on steady-state error reduction and transient response improvement, respectively.
   - The P controller was evaluated as a basic control approach, while the no overshoot control configuration aimed to achieve a smooth response without overshooting the setpoint.

4. Results:
   - The simulation results and analysis demonstrated the strengths and limitations of each controller configuration in terms of the performance measures.
   - The PID controller provided a good balance between steady-state error reduction, response speed, and stability.
   - The PI controller was effective in minimizing steady-state error but may result in slower response compared to PID control.
   - The PD controller helped improve transient response by reducing overshoot but may not address steady-state error.
   - The P controller exhibited slower response and steady-state error. 
   - The no overshoot control configuration achieved a smooth response without overshooting the setpoint, ensuring a stable and controlled system.

5. Recommendations:
   - Based on the project's findings, the PID controller configuration is generally recommended for systems requiring a balance between steady-state error, response speed, and stability.
   - However, the choice of controller configuration should consider the specific requirements and trade-offs of the system, such as the importance of steady-state error reduction, transient response improvement, or overshoot elimination.
